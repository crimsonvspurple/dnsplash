Inspired by the early-2000s game 'Small World' (later RotoHog), Dobbernomics was brought into creation in 2018 as a passion project by Darryl Dobbs ("Dobber"). It is a free game that takes real world buying and selling of players to determine the player's in-game value. Compete against the world, as well as against competitors in a league you created (optional) to build your roster value to the highest it can reach, and at the same time win by total fantasy points!


Those who fondly remember Small World, can't say enough about Dobbernomics. And those who never played nor remember SW go on and on about this "fun game" and "awesome concept". Dobbernomics stands out by offering a blend of realistic economic modeling and accessible gameplay. We've designed the game to be both challenging and enjoyable, making it suitable for players who love in-depth simulations as well as those who enjoy casual strategy play. Our goal is to provide a game that is intellectually stimulating yet fun and engaging.

Whether you're a seasoned gamer who breaks out the spreadsheets and analyzes the minutiae of the game play, or a newcomer to the genre who just wants to buy and sell players and just have fun, Dobbernomics offers a deep, rewarding gameplay experience that will test your skills and creativity.
